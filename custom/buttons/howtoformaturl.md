## What This Link Does

It's a special link that helps you make a GitHub Follow button for your website.

The basic link is:  
[https://yottube.github.io/custom/buttons/githubfollow.html](https://yottube.github.io/custom/buttons/githubfollow.html)

It uses extra bits of information to change how the button looks and works. Let's break those down:

- **`user=octocat`**: This part tells the button which GitHub user to follow. In this example, it's `"octocat"`.  
  ðŸ”„ Change `"octocat"` to your GitHub username.

- **`type=follow`**: This says we want a "Follow" button.

- **`count=true`**: This means the button will show how many followers that user has.

## How to Make Your Own Button

1. **Change the username**  
   In the link above, find `user=octocat`. Replace `"octocat"` with your own GitHub username (or the username of the person you want people to follow).

2. **Open the link**  
   Copy the link you've changed and paste it into your web browser's address bar. Press Enter.

3. **Get the code**  
   The page that opens will show you the HTML code for the button. This is the code you need to put on your website.

4. **Put the button on your site**  
   Copy the HTML code, and paste it into your website's code where you want the button to appear.
